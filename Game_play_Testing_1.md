**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> The game starts the player in a thorough but engaging tutorial that teaches the player the essantials plus a little extra. By the time 
I started playing the actual game I didnt find myself confused or lost. The game makes sures the player knows the rules of the game before 
they play it.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> When the player starts the only quests available are medium or hard difficulty, because of this the player would need to explore and search
for weak enemies to raise their level high enough to do any quests. This needs to be mended for the pacing of the game as players may not
want to spend extra time gathering levels just to play the main feature of the game, and players who don't want to spend extra time to 
raise levels will end up fustrated as it isn't possible to complete quests with low levels.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> This game is not targeted for casual audiences as it emphasizes difficulty and strategy. The game is very unforgiving and doesnt give 
any leeway to the player. The game is very strict on whether the player succeeds or fails.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> The game is not designed for casual players and so i believe the developers will focus on the artistic integrity to steadly build 
a following versus marketing it the masses. Therefore, timing is less relevant.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> Yes the skills and items blend well together allowing amazing combinations, such as attacking twice or dodging them. The character's 
statistics (Water, Food, Sanity, and Pain) really does add to the theme giving the player a sense of urgency and foreboding.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> I had fun playing the tutorial, but when I started the actual game i was fustrated that i couldnt complete the first quests available
so much so that i had to a little research to see if was playing the game wrong or some tips on how to succeed. When i discovered i had to 
gather extra levels before proceeding i was already too dejected to continue and opted to try again another time.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> The game doesnt seem to have any issues, but my experience may not be accurate. while I did play quite a bit I did not make a lot of 
progress.
