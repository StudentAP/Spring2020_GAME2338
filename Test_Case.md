## Test Steps: 
| # | Description | Expected Result | Check (âˆš) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 |Test the zombie side of be the zombie mode for any balancing issues that would affect the playability of the game.|I expect the game to allow the player to play their role effectively within reasonable boundries.|The zombie is only viable to play when the player reaches a level threshold that gives the character enough tools to play the game efficently.|			
| 2 |Test the survivor sid of be the zombie mode for any balancing issues that would affect the playability of the game.|I expect the game to allow the player to play their role effectively within reasonable boundries.|Just like the zombie side, The survivor is only viable to play when the player reaches a level threshold that gives the character enough tools to play the game efficently. However, unlike the zombie the player can reach levels without competeing with other players.|			
| 3 |Test the be the zombie mode for any exploits and cheats.|I expect there to be some exploits, but hopefully none that break the balancing of the game.|There are some game breaking bugs and exploits. These exploits will be added to the test case.|			
| 4 |If the player force closes the application the game will end and void the match. Therefore denying rewards and saving rank for all players involved.|I hope at the very least it isn't easily replicated or that the development team is working towards a solution.|Any player can force close the application to save rank and deny rewards for all players involved. By community guidelines this is considered cheating and there is no patch for it in the forseeable future.|			
| 5 |There is an exploit that re-enables an old gag in which drop kicking a zombie sends it flying.|I expect it to be a fun gag with little significance.|The cheat can be exploited in be the zombie mode and can be used to win the game easily by both teams. It is rarely used since it is considered a double edged sword for the cheater, but it still can be done.|			
| 6 |There is a dupilication glitch that is done by exploiting the UI system. Allowing the player to duplicate very important and rare items.|I expect the duplication method to be complicated or for the Devs to have patched it out.|The duplication glitch is still active and is easy to replicate. It's mainly done through overwhelming the UI systems with multiple inputs at once.|			
| 7 |Maxing out the player's level through the duplication exploit.|There is an item in the game that increases the player's level by collecting it. Since it is an item that can be dropped and stored, I expect it to be possible.|The player can max their level out by duplicating an item with the duplication exploit the gives them experience when collected. This exploit has not been patched.|			
| 8 |There is a rare bug in which an extra zombie can enter during the be the zombie mode. The game orginally has only one zombie.|Since the game mode was designed for one zombie at a tim, i don't think this is an exploit since rewards would have trouble being distributed.|In some very rare cases during match making two zombie will join the same lobby. While footage of the bug do exist, this has been patched and no longer exists.|			
| 9 |It is possible to trap the zombie and allow the survivors to win without difficulty.|I expect this to be a one time gag since tricks like these only fool players once or for it to be patched since it is a game breaking exploit.|It was possible to trap the zombie by using prop items that the zombie cannot interact with. This has been patched is no longer possible to do.|			
| 10 |Host Latency issues. Sometimes if the host is having latency issues hit boxes freeze in which the players will still take damage.|I know such things are hard to fix. I dnot know what to expect.|If the host expriences lag through uncontrollable or controllable means then the zombie's hitbox freeze and still takes damage. This has not been solved, but lessend through stricter match making criterias.|			

## Overall Test Status:
Test is conlcuded.
