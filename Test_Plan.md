# Section 1: General Information

## Summary
This project is being done to determine if there any changes that need to made to the game or provide useful information that can be used
in developing future releases. The software being used is mostly done by field testing and information gathering.

## Environment/User Community
The main tester in this plan will be Angel V. Pina. The testing will be done through online meetings and within all individuals living space.

## Test Objectives
The objectives of every test is if certain features and/or known entities are considered acceptable within the a criteria. The tests 
will be comprised of the techincal aspects of the game.

## Acceptance Criteria
Tests are only considered viable if they are within the technical aspects of the game.They are also viable if the affect the game in 
significant way such as:skipping squences, exploiting in a competitve setting, or circumventing features. The test case must also pass 
total number of six tests to considered acceptable.

# Section 2: Plan
## Test Description
Where going to be gatherig information on exploits and bugs and then attempt to recreate them. If an exploit is recreated the test is 
passed and if we cannot we will base it on how much information we have on the exploit.

## Test Team
Angel V. Pina will oversee the testing.

## Milestones
The tests will mostly be done in the individual's home. Online meetings must be attended to report status. Dates of testing will be flexible
and the test phases are done individually.

## Budgets
There are no funds allocated.
