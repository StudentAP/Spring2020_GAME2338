### Rating
On a score from one 1 to 10. I give Outward a 7. It's far from perfect. It has a lot of good things, but some very important bad things like bugs.

## Summary
This game is all about the adventurer's life. The game starts the player off with little to nothing and I mean that in the honest sense.
The player will endure hardships like beasts and bandits, but they also have to endure nature itself by trying to stay fed and warm. Dying is the
least of your problems, whenever you "fall" in game one of many scenarios will occur. You might get enslaved by bandits, you could get dragged into a den of beasts
,you could be saved by divine intervention, and if your playing in hardcore your character can die permanently.

The game does a great job at building your character and since you start from the ground up it feels just as rewarding. There is no leveling
 up in Outward your character becomes stronger from trainers who teach you active and passive skills that can boosts stats or deal with mutliple 
 foes at once. As you get more money you can choose to specialize with a trainer and learn advanced skils, but you can only specialize three times
 which has created a "Build" culture within the game. One last thing the ties with building characters is the "Legacy" system in which a character 
 can store items that can later be retrieved by new characters by following an existing character's Legacy, this is another reason staying alive is important.
 
 My favorite part of the game is the ritualistic and delibrate magic system. Magic in Outward is not designed to be simple. It can also be 
 considered an investment as you can only gain mana by sacrificing health and stamina not to mention that the change is permanent. However, 
 don't let these things scare you from trying it out; the magic in Outward is very fun and gratifying especialy if you have a coop partner. 
 Magic boils down to using two objects or spells together to create a powerful force. For example, one of the first spell you'll learn is flame thrower
  which requires the character to hold a torch or a lamp an then casting the spell to create a gush fire. Other spells require the character to
  stand on a magical sigil or combine certain runes together, it's just fun to create spells from combining objects or powers togther.

## Final Thoughts
Like I stated before this game is far from perfect, but it does fills that niche of exploration and hardships that few games are attempting to 
fill. I recommend giving it a try especially if it's on sale. The team working on it are dedicated and have even released and update the brings 
secret end game bosses and loot.
