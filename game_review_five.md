### Rating

I love this game a lot and I still end up playing the game time and time again. I give it a 10/10.

## Summary

First off the game is fairly challenging and expects the player to learn the various attacks that enemies can do, like waiting for a big bulky foe 
to wind up his attack and then striking after he misses. However, should the player die he loses all his geo (the currency of the game) 
and loses his ability to use magic frequently. To make matters worse a ghost appears where the player had died serving as a reminder of
their failures, but should the player defeat their ghost they'll be rewarded with all the geo they have lost and their magic restored to
them hence teaching players to know their foes by rewarding them.

Next the game gets progressively more complex as you play it. When the player starts the game they only have several abilities such as 
jumping, running, and attacking. Later in the game the player learns their first new move "dash" which is later given a quick tutorial on
how to use and apply it. With the new dash ability the player unlocks whole new levels that were previously unaccessable and adds more 
depth to combat and exploration. The game does a very great job of introducing a new mechanic and then giving the player a brief explaination
on how to use it.

Lastly the world of Hollow Knight is amazing and the story of the bug kingdom is told in snippets. If you ever take a moment from the 
adventuring and simply look behind scenes you'll see how abandoned the world really is. In the run down stations there are loads of empty 
carts symbolizing that at one point of time those places were the busiest parts of the kingdom. As you play the game you'll soon start 
memorizing names of important people that you'll never meet, but would love to know the stories of and soon the player will learn why 
they have to defeat the Hollow knight in the first place.

## Final Thoughts

Hollow Knight is an amazing game and some reviewers have even started refrencing it on how games should be designed. The game seemingly
caters to every kind of demograph. It has a super hard permanent death mode for the hardcore gamers that love a challenge. It is very 
beautiful using 2D traditional animation. The only bad thing I can think of is that it ends and even then the game has recently added a 
new DLC that allows the player to fight their favorite bosses with an added challenge. I believe Hollow Knight is game worthy enough to 
set a standard on game design.
