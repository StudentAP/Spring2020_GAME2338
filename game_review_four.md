### Rating

I rate this game 7 out of 10. I know many reviews have often rated it lower for its lack of content and at that time I would've agreed with them, but after so 
much time has passed the game has been constantly updated and is at a good point with its player base. Even now there still much more to 
come and the game is only going up from here.

## Summary

The main gameplay is of course the ship and how the players interact with it. Before the player jumps into game they have to choose a crew
size from one to four. The crew size determines what kind of ship is available for the player or players. This is important since a big 
ship is much harder to manage by a single player and a small ship would be little help to a full size crew. Being able to sail your ship
effectively is important since it is the player's only mode of transportation between islands and if your ships sinks than that means
you'll have to respawn a new one which would also forfit any loot your original ship was carrying. When it comes to sailing the ship it is
actually quite easy, fun, and exciting the dev team did real good job designing how it is controlled so don't feel too intimidated.

Loot is everything in this game. While how you play the game is all up to you it all still boils down to getting paid one way or another.
While you can find yourself a modest collection from just exploring island after island there are also factions that'll pay you for your
troubles. These factions offer voyages based on a general types of tasks such as treasure hunting, bounties, and trading just to name a few.
The more you complete a faction's voyage the more reputation you gain from that faction from which you can unlock exclusive titles, tools, and even 
higher paying voyages.

Lastly there is combat. The sea of Athena has its fair share of dangers one of them including you the player. Of course this wouldn't be
a pirate game if you couldn't pirate loot from other players. As you explore the islands take note that you and your crew are not alone.
There are other crews of pirates out there adventuring for gold much like you and they won't hesitate to take yours aswell. Eventually, 
your crew will clash with others on land or by sea. Your crew must fight to protect your loot and/or try steal the loot of your foes. At 
sea is crucial that your crew sinks your rivals' ship by puncturing the hull with cannon balls, but be aware while you're busy fighting they
may board your ship to take you on personally. Once the smoke settles your crew can begin salvaging the destroyed ship for loot and other
supplies for the next battle.

## Final Thoughts

I love this game because I have always loved ships and Sea of Thieves gives a fun and relaxing simulation of sailing a ship. The game is
also very beautifully designed from the islands to even the sea itself being breath taking. Unfortantely the game has had a very rough start
as it had launched with little to no content and it give the game a bad reputation similar to "No Man's Sky", But after the game's many updates
and additions I am hopeful that'll soon become a must play title in the future.
