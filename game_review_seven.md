### Rating

I give this game a 9/10. Its inticing and has hours of content. Not to mention the replayability is also really good.

## Summary

To start off the best and most important thing of every role-playing game is creating a character. As I stated before the replayability
is amazing, There are many ways to build your character and as result every playthrough feels unique. The uniqueness of a characer
also comes from how many ways the player can play the game. You can create a brute of character to charge into danger or a calculating 
mastermind that convinces others to see things their way. One very important thing in character development is perks and there are a lot,
so much so that there is no shortage of combinations you can make with them.

Next is the world of Fallout: New Vegas. The game takes place at the Mojave desert; yet the world as we know it is gone as many buildings
are destroyed, abandoned cars liter the roads, and strange new dangers prowl the desert. The game has a crazy setting that has a feeling of 
both desolation and hope as surviors struggle to adapt and rebuild the society they once knew. However, settlers are not the only ones 
trying to survive. As the player plays the game they'll discover blood thirsty raiders, horrifying mutants, and warring factions each trying
to claim a piece of the Majove desert.

Lastly the gameplay. In Fallout:New Vegas there is always more than one way for the player to achieve their goals. Combat is the favorite
resort for most players and the game gives you a lot of ways to destroy your foes. You can find and perfect melee weapons that can slice
limbs clean off or build a futuristic lightinng cannon to turn your enemies to ash. You can play it safely and use stealth to sabotage 
unsuspecting targets like hacking robots to turn on their masters or plant a live gernade in the pocket a very unlucky bandit. You can 
also play the peace maker and talk your foes into seeing things in a different light or not. This is just to name a few, but there is no 
end to how the player can play the game.

## Final Thoughts

Fallout:New Vegas is game to be called a classic, an example of a extraordinary game, and just a blast to play. Personally it was my first
game of the franchise and it introduced me to the whole series making it one of my favorites to ever play. I'm not the only who loves this
game as this one in paticular has a dedicated following with countless mods that support the game and with the biggest one yet to come as
fans are working to rebuild the entire game with Fallout 4's new engine.
I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves role-playing games with great action 
and compeling worlds.
