### Rating

I give this game a 9/10 out of ten only because it's not perfect. One of the most annoying things the game does is make enemies that your 
troops can clearly see untargetable, but even then it is a rare occurence.

## Summary

The main gameplay revolves around positioning troops to better combat enemies and complete objectives. When a troop can fire on an enemy
they're given a ratio on how much of chance the shoot will hit it's mark. This is where postioning is key as an enemy in open is a an easy
target, but a foe behind good cover isn't and the same applies to the player's troops. Simple enough, stay in cover and aim for enemies 
that are easy to hit. However, the aliens have the same mind set and soon the player will have to make more complex strategies to achieve
victory; Such as keeping a troop on look out on a high platform or flaking the enemy while they're distracted. The creation of tactics on
certain situtations and the adaption of them when things change is the core of XCOM.

When I use the term troop I'm simply stating any capable unit that can be used by the player, but the player has a range of types of units
that can be used on the battle field and even further customized invidually. Every type of troop has their strengths and weaknesses. For
Example, the sniper is a longe range unit that can be used to deal heavy support fire safely from a distance or be used to pick off weaker 
enemies. We can even go further by equiping the sniper with a scope that makes them more accurate and giving them a grappling hook to get
to high places. There is a catch, If a troop takes enough damage then they'll have to take some time to heal there wounds which may put them 
out of the next mission. While tactics are needed to win troop management is also vital.

Lastly an organization needs funds to keep in working order. The XCOM base is where the player will spend their time off the battle field
and build facilities to equip troops and futher XCOM's objectives, but to do that the player needs money. As the alien threat spreads around
the world, governments will want XCOM to operate and monitor their territories, but to do so will take resources and XCOM can't be everywhere
at once. The player will have to choose one mission over two others as well as the reward being offered, but should XCOM ignore a country
for to long they'll leave the XCOM project and cut fundings to fend for themselves. The player's early choices impact their future situations.

## Final Thoughts

I love XCOM a lot and have replayed the game numerous times. One of the best feelings in the game is when a plan goes so perfectly that 
your troops never got a scratch and the game acknowledges it. At the opposite side of the spectrum, One of the worst feelings in the game
is when a troop (maybe even your favorite) dies. Especially if it was due to a careless mistake. The game will test you and continue to do
so til you've finished it.
