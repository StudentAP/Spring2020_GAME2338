# Game Review for The Geneforge Saga

## Details

The Geneforge series was designed by Jeff Vogel a programmer for Spiderweb Software which was best known for their Avernum series and 
its predecessor the Exile series. During the developement of Avernum 2 Jeff had been working on Geneforge as side project for himself.
 Jeff was orginally skeptical of his game and was afraid it would deter the audiences who are more familiar with Avernum, but to his suprise the
  game's sales had exceeded exppectations dispite the game limitations and the series would have another four installments.

### Game Title

### Rating

I give this game an 8 out of 10. The games have very out dated graphics, a handful of sound effects, and each have a single music track
(main menu screen). However, the games' storylines, settings, and well structured scripts more than makes up for their lack of graphics 
and sound.

## Summary

The first and most important mechanic in the game is actually the plotline. While yes there are many games that have different endings and
extensive ways to achieve goals in games, but very few games that i've ever seen have ever came close to how flexible the paths that
 the players can choose in Geneforge.
While to some this might not be big or important detail, but any experienced designer knows that this mechanic takes a lot more time implement
perfectly and can even be considered a gamble if the players decide to continue playing the game after finishing it. However, If the story and 
game come out well than it means much more content and playtime for the players.



## Final Thoughts

Describe in as much detail as possible what you did and didn't enjoy about the
game and list out your reasons why. Remember this is a review and thus should
stand up to some criticism when making your reasons why you thought this way
about particular features of the game. This should be at a minimum of 1
paragraph.
