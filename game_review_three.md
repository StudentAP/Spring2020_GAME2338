# Game Review for The Geneforge Saga

## Details

The Geneforge series was designed by Jeff Vogel a programmer for Spiderweb Software which was best known for their Avernum series and 
its predecessor the Exile series. During the developement of Avernum 2 Jeff had been working on Geneforge as side project for himself.
 Jeff was orginally skeptical of his game and was afraid it would deter the audiences who are more familiar with Avernum, but to his suprise the
  game's sales had exceeded exppectations dispite the game limitations and the series would have another four installments.

### Game Title

### Rating

I give this game an 8 out of 10. The games have very out dated graphics, a handful of sound effects, and each have a single music track
(main menu screen). However, the games' storylines, settings, and well structured scripts more than makes up for their lack of graphics 
and sound.

## Summary

The first and most important mechanic in the game is actually the plotline. While yes there are many games that have different endings and
extensive ways to achieve goals in games, but very few games that i've ever seen have ever came close to how flexible the paths that
 the players can choose in Geneforge.
While to some this might not be big or important detail, but any experienced designer knows that this mechanic takes a lot more time implement
perfectly and can even be considered a gamble if the players decide to continue playing the game after finishing it. However, If the story and 
game come out well than it means much more content and playtime for the players.

The role-playing aspect of the game is a bit difficult to understand at first, but it left me hungry for more ways to build my
character into a powerful force. When the player starts a new game they are given a choice between three classes (more would be added in
later installments): The Shaper - The summoner classes that focuses on creating multiple and stronger creatures, but leaves the player 
relying on their strong and dispensible companions. The Guardian - the warrior class with strong melee and missle skills with the some 
knowledge in creation to create a few creatures for help, but are lacking in magical skills needed for spells. The Agent - the mage 
class is strong in magic and is quite comptent in combat skills making them a powerful solo character, but they have the most trouble 
creating creatures which may be necessary to escaping certain situations.

The power to create creatures that will help you on your journey is surprisingly a sparse game mechanic the barely any games touch upon, 
but that can be understandable as the coding would probably be immense since it involves creating a persistent entity at anytime 
anywhere and then destroying it anytime anywhere. Geneforge however pulls it off neatly. The main theme of the game is the power of 
creating life and the responsiblities (and dangers) that come with it, and believe me it doesn't let you forget it. In the first level
you are taught how to create your first creature the Fryoa a reptile that can spit fire. As you play the game you'll learn how to make 
new creatures and each of them fall with in one of three categories. Fire Shaping - are projectile focused creatures with a bit of
melee. Battle Shaping - are creatures capable of taking hits and giving back bigger ones, but they can't attack at range forcing them to 
close the distance. Magic Shaping - are strong hitting creatures with a mix of range and melee combat,but they run out of energy quick 
and are also more fragile than other creations. As you play you could stick to one type of creature or a healthy mix of them, but before
you go making an army there are limtations to your craft. Essence is essential to magic and creation with every creature you have you 
lose a portion of your essence meaning you can only have so much of one creature, and also to take in account is magic since the 
more powerful spells use essence you're going to want to save some. One thing you can do to save essence is make your creatures 
dumber, but you will no longer be able to dictate what they do in battle which you might not like and if things are going awful 
for them amid combat they might just run away or worse turn against you. How you create and dictate your creations is all on you.

## Final Thoughts

I love the idea of creating creatures that assist you uniquely and this game is my favorite for making that sort of experience. 
As stated before I'm suprised there virtually no games like this or even half as close to the general idea of Geneforge. If you're
going into this game for amazing graphics or memorable music tracks than this game isn't for you. This game is mainly played for its 
great story and gameplay. However, If you want both than I suggest giving a look at Spiderweb Software's kickstarter to remake the game
with everything it didn't have in Genefore 1-Mutegen. It may be the next hit game to hit retail.
