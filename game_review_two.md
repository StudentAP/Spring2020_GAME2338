### Rating

I give this game a 9 out of 10 It's fun and engaging, but the only problem I have is that you have to pay in order to unlock the rest of the game's guns and tools. All the upgrades come out to 8 bucks.

## Summary

The game takes place in its own universe and chronologically it takes place after the game Radiant which is a space shooter game. The commander is the former pilot of the spaceship named The Radiant who comes across the main antagonist from the previous game The Supercreep 
who once again is trying to conquer all of know space. The Supercreep is attempting to destory space installations by sending hordes of aliens to crash into the stations' power conduits and your job is to set up defenses to prevent that.

One very unique feature in the game are the modules which are placeble blocks that can have defenses mounted on but also used to cut off 
areas and redirect the hordes into certain corridors or away from shortcuts to the power conduit. These allow the player to come up with 
different strategies with every encounter or level and even mix up completed ones. The player could create a single corridor to the 
power conduit but it's heavily defended or a long spiraling hallway with spreaded defense but the entrance containing weapons that 
weaken the targets.

On top of the cool future guns that are available in the game the player can also build mega structures. These giant defenses can turn 
the tide in most situations which are helpful since at the end of every level you're meet with a devestating challenge like a giant 
robot or a swarm of health regenerating bugs. These are by far the most expensive but most rewarding weapons in the game. My personal 
favorite is the laser cannon that destroys everything that passes throught it.

## Final Thoughts

The game is really fun and is a good time waster like if you're waiting in an office. The scoring system is also really cool since you 
unlock aliens when you meet a score threshold and that has made come back at times to try and improve my score. The only thing I really
don't like is how the upgrades are sold in batches and are seprate from the game. While you don't need the upgrades to beat the game,
they're also a good chunk of the game's over all entertainment.
