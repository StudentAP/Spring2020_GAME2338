# Quality Lab from Angel Pina on Team A

## Call of Duty: Zombies

We considered CoD Zombies a good game based on its qualities. First off the game is well scripted as there are very little to no bugs or glitchs and as the waves increase the game doesn't suffer under the weight of hundreds of zombies and or other entities active at the time.
It has a simple but still appealing UI and Levels. The gameplay is a fun and has very high replayability that is also suitable for all types of players in general. It even has thriving map making community.

## Dying Light

Another contender in the zombies genre is Dying Light. There's virtually no game like Dying Light with its first person heart pumping parkour zombies action. One thing that makes the game great is the fact the game gets progressively more fun as you play through it. The 
game runs smoothly and the player's movement within the game is very fluid and flows well with the player's actions. The game also very tense PvP mode which is honestly my favorite as it involves both players using every ounce of their ablities and knowledge of their surroundings to achieve victory, all and all a fun time.
